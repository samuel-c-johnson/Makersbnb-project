# Makersbnb-project

The challenge- build a clone of Airbnb as a team.

After holding a meeting with the team it was decided that instead of using ruby and html, which we had all used before,
we would use javascript and Node.js. The team made this decision because we wanted to test ourselves by building a web app using unfamiliar technologies.

We encountered several issues whilst working on the project. First and foremost we struggled to set up a testing framework. We initially tried Karma but were unable to make it work. We then proceeded to use Zombie and Mocha but we found a lack of documentation and again were unable to make it work.

During the project we held daily stand ups in the mornings to plan our approach and to make sure everyone knew what they were doing. Secondly every evening we held retros to consolidate what we had learned and achieved that day.
